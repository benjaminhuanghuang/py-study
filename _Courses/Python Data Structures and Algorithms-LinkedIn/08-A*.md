# A*

The Manhattan Distance: is a way to measure the distance between two points by only moving horizontally and vertically, like navigating city blocks in Manhattan's grid street layout.

## Key Values in the A* Algorithm

- G value: best distance from start to current cell
- H value: heuristic distance from current cell to destination
- F value: the sum of the G value and the H value (representing the probable optimal value or minimum distance based on the heuristic used)

## Algorithm

PQ: [(Cell, F-Value)]

Get highest priority item from PQ (min F-Value):
Is it the goal?
If so, we are done
Otherwise:
    put undiscovered neighbours,
    calculate f-values
    update predecessors
Repeat until queue is empty
